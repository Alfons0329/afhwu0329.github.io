The first player always places X characters, while the second player always places O characters. X and O characters are always placed into empty squares, never filled ones. The game ends when there are 3 of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal. The game also ends if all squares are non-empty. No more moves can be played if the game is over. \u4e00\u5b9a\u8981\u662fx\u5148\u653b\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u6709\u4efb\u4e00\u65b9\u7372\u52dd\u5f8c\u5247\u4e0d\u53ef\u4ee5\u518d\u4e0b\u6a19\u8a18\uff0c\u7372\u52dd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u540c\u50b3\u7d71\u4e95\u5b57\u904a\u6232\u3002 \u5f9e\u908f\u8f2f\u4f86\u770b\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u6211\u5011\u7d71\u8a08o\u7684\u500b\u6578\u4ee5\u53cax\u7684\u500b\u6578 \u7531\u65bc\u662f\u8f2a\u6d41\u9032\u884c \uff0c\u4e14\u5148x\u5f8co\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64x\u81f3\u591a\u6bd4o\u591a\u51fa1\uff0c\u800c\u4e14o\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u5927\u65bcx\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u90fd\u662f\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5148\u522a\u9664 if ( xcnt == 0 ocnt == 1 ) { return 0 ; } else if ( xcnt ocnt + 1 || ocnt xcnt + 1 ) { return 0 ; } else if ( ocnt xcnt ) { return 0 ; } \u63a5\u4e0b\u4f86\u6aa2\u67e5\u7372\u52dd\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u7576\u7372\u52dd\u6642\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u6709\u4e00\u6b21\u7684\u7372\u52dd\uff0c\u4ea6\u5373\u4e0d\u80fd\u6709ooo xxx\u540c\u6642\u51fa\u73fe\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1 \u56e0\u6b64\u6211\u5011\u7528 win_cnt\u4f86\u7d71\u8a08\u7372\u52dd\u7684\u6b21\u6578\uff0c\u53ea\u8981 win_cnt 1\u4e00\u5b9a\u662f\u4e0d\u5408\u6cd5\u7684\u7d50\u69cb\u3002 \u800c\u5728\u7372\u52dd\u5f8c\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5224\u65b7\u662fx\u7372\u52dd\u6216\u662fo\u7372\u52dd \u82e5\u662fx\u7372\u52dd\uff0c\u5247o\u4e00\u5b9a\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd =x \uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u4e43\u662fx\u7372\u52dd\u5f8c\u904a\u6232\u4fbf\u7d50\u675f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6b64\u6642\u7684x\u82e5\u662f\u6bd4o\u591a\u4e00\u5247\u6b63\u597d\u7b26\u5408\u898f\u5247 \u800c\u82e5\u662fo\u7372\u52dd\uff0c\u5247o\u300e\u53ea\u80fd\u300f\u548cx\u4e00\u6a23\u591a\uff0c\u4e00\u6a23\u7684\u9053\u7406\uff0c\u7372\u52dd\u5f8c\u904a\u6232\u4fbf\u6703\u7d50\u675f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5c0d\u65bc xcnt\u90fd\u662f\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1 \u5b8c\u6574AC\u4ee3\u78bc\u5982\u4e0b\uff08\u7db2\u8def\u8d85\u5361\u9813\u7121\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528debug\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ea\u597d\u6012\u7528submit solution\u4f86\u9a57\u8b49\u6b63\u78ba\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u4e0d\u89ba\u5403\u4e868\u500b\u7f70\u5206\u554a\u6b98\u5ff5...) //[ XOX , O O , XOX ] class Solution { public : int xcnt , ocnt ; bool validTicTacToe ( vector string board ) { xcnt = 0 ; ocnt = 0 ; for ( int i = 0 ; i board . size (); i ++ ) { for ( int j = 0 ; j board [ i ]. size (); j ++ ) { if ( board [ i ][ j ] == O ) { ocnt ++ ; } else if ( board [ i ][ j ] == X ) { xcnt ++ ; } } } if ( xcnt == 0 ocnt == 1 ) { return 0 ; } else if ( xcnt ocnt + 1 || ocnt xcnt + 1 ) { return 0 ; } else if ( ocnt xcnt ) { return 0 ; } else if ( ! checkwin ( board )) { return 0 ; } return 1 ; } bool checkwin ( vector string board ) { int win_cnt = 0 ; int xwin = 0 , owin = 0 ; for ( int i = 0 ; i board . size (); i ++ ) { if ( board [ i ][ 0 ] == board [ i ][ 1 ] board [ i ][ 0 ] == board [ i ][ 2 ] board [ i ][ 0 ] != ) { if ( board [ i ][ 0 ] == X ) { xwin = 1 ; } else { owin = 1 ; } win_cnt ++ ; } } for ( int i = 0 ; i 3 ; i ++ ) { if ( board [ 0 ][ i ] == board [ 1 ][ i ] board [ 0 ][ i ] == board [ 2 ][ i ] board [ 0 ][ i ] != ) { if ( board [ 0 ][ i ] == X ) { xwin = 1 ; } else { owin = 1 ; } win_cnt ++ ; } } if ( board [ 0 ][ 0 ] == board [ 1 ][ 1 ] board [ 0 ][ 0 ] == board [ 2 ][ 2 ] board [ 0 ][ 0 ] != ) { if ( board [ 0 ][ 0 ] == X ) { xwin = 1 ; } else { owin = 1 ; } win_cnt ++ ; } if ( board [ 0 ][ 2 ] == board [ 1 ][ 1 ] board [ 0 ][ 2 ] == board [ 2 ][ 0 ] board [ 0 ][ 2 ] != ) { if ( board [ 0 ][ 2 ] == X ) { xwin = 1 ; } else { owin = 1 ; } win_cnt ++ ; } if ( win_cnt == 0 ) return 1 ; else if ( win_cnt == 1 ) { if ( xwin ) { if ( ocnt = xcnt ) { return 0 ; } else if ( xcnt == ocnt + 1 ) { return 1 ; } else { return 0 ; } } else if ( owin ) { if ( ocnt xcnt ) { return 0 ; } else if ( xcnt == ocnt ) { return 1 ; } else if ( ocnt xcnt ) { return 0 ; } } } else { return 0 ; } } }; PB. 792.

No more moves can be played if the game is over. \u4e00\u5b9a\u8981\u662fx\u5148\u653b\uff0c\u4e26\u4e14\u6709\u4efb\u4e00\u65b9\u7372\u52dd\u5f8c\u5247\u4e0d\u53ef\u4ee5\u518d\u4e0b\u6a19\u8a18\uff0c\u7372\u52dd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u540c\u50b3\u7d71\u4e95\u5b57\u904a\u6232\u3002 \u5f9e\u908f\u8f2f\u4f86\u770b\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u6211\u5011\u7d71\u8a08o\u7684\u500b\u6578\u4ee5\u53cax\u7684\u500b\u6578 \u7531\u65bc\u662f\u8f2a\u6d41\u9032\u884c \uff0c\u4e14\u5148x\u5f8co\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64x\u81f3\u591a\u6bd4o\u591a\u51fa1\uff0c\u800c\u4e14o\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u5927\u65bcx\uff0c\u9019\u4e9b\u90fd\u662f\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5148\u522a\u9664 if ( xcnt == 0 ocnt == 1 ) { return 0 ; } else if ( xcnt ocnt + 1 || ocnt xcnt + 1 ) { return 0 ; } else if ( ocnt xcnt ) { return 0 ; } \u63a5\u4e0b\u4f86\u6aa2\u67e5\u7372\u52dd\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u7576\u7372\u52dd\u6642\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u6709\u4e00\u6b21\u7684\u7372\u52dd\uff0c\u4ea6\u5373\u4e0d\u80fd\u6709ooo xxx\u540c\u6642\u51fa\u73fe\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1 \u56e0\u6b64\u6211\u5011\u7528 win_cnt\u4f86\u7d71\u8a08\u7372\u52dd\u7684\u6b21\u6578\uff0c\u53ea\u8981 win_cnt 1\u4e00\u5b9a\u662f\u4e0d\u5408\u6cd5\u7684\u7d50\u69cb\u3002 \u800c\u5728\u7372\u52dd\u5f8c\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5224\u65b7\u662fx\u7372\u52dd\u6216\u662fo\u7372\u52dd \u82e5\u662fx\u7372\u52dd\uff0c\u5247o\u4e00\u5b9a\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd =x \uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u4e43\u662fx\u7372\u52dd\u5f8c\u904a\u6232\u4fbf\u7d50\u675f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6b64\u6642\u7684x\u82e5\u662f\u6bd4o\u591a\u4e00\u5247\u6b63\u597d\u7b26\u5408\u898f\u5247 \u800c\u82e5\u662fo\u7372\u52dd\uff0c\u5247o\u300e\u53ea\u80fd\u300f\u548cx\u4e00\u6a23\u591a\uff0c\u4e00\u6a23\u7684\u9053\u7406\uff0c\u7372\u52dd\u5f8c\u904a\u6232\u4fbf\u6703\u7d50\u675f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5c0d\u65bc xcnt\u90fd\u662f\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1 \u5b8c\u6574AC\u4ee3\u78bc\u5982\u4e0b\uff08\u7db2\u8def\u8d85\u5361\u9813\u7121\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528debug\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ea\u597d\u6012\u7528submit solution\u4f86\u9a57\u8b49\u6b63\u78ba\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u4e0d\u89ba\u5403\u4e868\u500b\u7f70\u5206\u554a\u6b98\u5ff5...) //[ XOX , O O , XOX ] class Solution { public : int xcnt , ocnt ; bool validTicTacToe ( vector string board ) { xcnt = 0 ; ocnt = 0 ; for ( int i = 0 ; i board . size (); i ++ ) { for ( int j = 0 ; j board [ i ]. size (); j ++ ) { if ( board [ i ][ j ] == O ) { ocnt ++ ; } else if ( board [ i ][ j ] == X ) { xcnt ++ ; } } } if ( xcnt == 0 ocnt == 1 ) { return 0 ; } else if ( xcnt ocnt + 1 || ocnt xcnt + 1 ) { return 0 ; } else if ( ocnt xcnt ) { return 0 ; } else if ( ! checkwin ( board )) { return 0 ; } return 1 ; } bool checkwin ( vector string board ) { int win_cnt = 0 ; int xwin = 0 , owin = 0 ; for ( int i = 0 ; i board . size (); i ++ ) { if ( board [ i ][ 0 ] == board [ i ][ 1 ] board [ i ][ 0 ] == board [ i ][ 2 ] board [ i ][ 0 ] != ) { if ( board [ i ][ 0 ] == X ) { xwin = 1 ; } else { owin = 1 ; } win_cnt ++ ; } } for ( int i = 0 ; i 3 ; i ++ ) { if ( board [ 0 ][ i ] == board [ 1 ][ i ] board [ 0 ][ i ] == board [ 2 ][ i ] board [ 0 ][ i ] != ) { if ( board [ 0 ][ i ] == X ) { xwin = 1 ; } else { owin = 1 ; } win_cnt ++ ; } } if ( board [ 0 ][ 0 ] == board [ 1 ][ 1 ] board [ 0 ][ 0 ] == board [ 2 ][ 2 ] board [ 0 ][ 0 ] != ) { if ( board [ 0 ][ 0 ] == X ) { xwin = 1 ; } else { owin = 1 ; } win_cnt ++ ; } if ( board [ 0 ][ 2 ] == board [ 1 ][ 1 ] board [ 0 ][ 2 ] == board [ 2 ][ 0 ] board [ 0 ][ 2 ] != ) { if ( board [ 0 ][ 2 ] == X ) { xwin = 1 ; } else { owin = 1 ; } win_cnt ++ ; } if ( win_cnt == 0 ) return 1 ; else if ( win_cnt == 1 ) { if ( xwin ) { if ( ocnt = xcnt ) { return 0 ; } else if ( xcnt == ocnt + 1 ) { return 1 ; } else { return 0 ; } } else if ( owin ) { if ( ocnt xcnt ) { return 0 ; } else if ( xcnt == ocnt ) { return 1 ; } else if ( ocnt xcnt ) { return 0 ; } } } else { return 0 ; } } };","title":"PA. 794.

Key idea of this project The PWM(Pulse Width Modulation) Wiki PWM cycle (HV/ALL) = The proportion where light lights, the longer HV lasts, the brighter of the certain part of RGB(either one) will do. The Pulse Width can be used to simulate the analog output like this. PWM Video The same is true of other 3 colors, configuring with the following code and expanations. Basic logic for this project Initialize system - PWM and timer configuration - Presskey - Color changing scheme along with ADC light intensity detection for power saving. int keypad_value [ 4 ][ 4 ] = {{ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 }, { 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 }, { 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 }, { 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 }}; keypad explanation 0 red+ 1 green+ 2 blue+ 3 cycle_speed+ 4 red- 5 green- 6 blue- 7 customize mode(0 1 2 4 5 6 applicable) 8 only red 9 only green 10 only blue 11 light ADC mode 12 red+greren 13 green+blue 14 red+blue 15 off system, remember the last state, s.t. user configuration is not lost after shut down Setup the PWM channel Refer to this pdf for PWM channel-GPIO port configuration, each port has its corresponding PWM channel and built-in system clock, be sure to make it right!

It's time to change the color. Initialize to different duty cycle. Each color has its own PWM cycle, by setting the PWM cycle differently, we will be able to interleave 3 colors and mixing them together since there pulse waves have \"time shifting (or say phase shifting)\" to each other. #define RED_START 10 #define GREEN_START 91 #define BLUE_START 172 duty_cycle_R = RED_START ; duty_cycle_G = GREEN_START ; duty_cycle_B = BLUE_START ; int main () { //use the time delay mode to make the interleaving and the color changing scheme fpu_enable (); keypad_init (); GPIO_init_AF (); Timer_init (); configureADC (); startADC (); duty_cycle_R = RED_START ; duty_cycle_G = GREEN_START ; duty_cycle_B = BLUE_START ; cur_state = CYCLE_MODE ; while ( 1 ) { PWM_channel_init (); chromatic_scheme ( keypad_scan ()); } return 0 ; } Increase, decrease and cycle. state_color is the state indicating whether to increase the pulse cycle or decrease, with an view to simulating the sin-wave-like phase wave. void cycle_mode ( int delay_time ){ PWM_channel_init (); if ( state_R ){ if ( duty_cycle_R SECOND_SLICE ){ state_R = 0 ; } else { duty_cycle_R += 20 ; } } else { if ( duty_cycle_R 20 ){ state_R = 1 ; } else { duty_cycle_R -= 20 ; } } if ( state_G ){ if ( duty_cycle_G SECOND_SLICE ){ state_G = 0 ; } else { duty_cycle_G += 40 ; } } else { if ( duty_cycle_G 40 ){ state_G = 1 ; } else { duty_cycle_G -= 40 ; } } if ( state_B ){ if ( duty_cycle_B SECOND_SLICE ){ state_B = 0 ; } else { duty_cycle_B += 50 ; } } else { if ( duty_cycle_B 50 ){ state_B = 1 ; } else { duty_cycle_B -= 50 ; } } set_timer (); start_timer (); delay_ms ( delay_time ); } Customizable mode If it is in the customize mode, we are able to increase the proportion of color, to achieve that, just increase/decrease the duty cycle of that color. DELTA_VALUE is used to adjust the amount of duty cycle applied in PWM mode. case 4 : { if ( duty_cycle_R DELTA_VALUE ) duty_cycle_R -= DELTA_VALUE ; ( or add the DELTA_VALUE ) else duty_cycle_R = 0 ; break ; } Part4. More idea: the ADC of light-sensitive resistor The Earth is now facing the serve global warming, it is vital for us to construct a power saving model, consequently Alice and I came out the idea of using the ADC to detect the light intensity. Concept of ADC configuration credit to my classmate's hackMD (Add later) The stronger the intensity, the dimmer the light to be to saving the energy since this module is aimed for atmosphere night light. ADC Code is here case 11 : { // light ADC mode for keypad key11 cur_state = LIGHT_MODE ; break ; } if ( cur_state == LIGHT_MODE ) { get_light_resistor (); light = 255 - (( resistor_value - REF_LIGHT ) / 10 ); duty_cycle_R = light ; duty_cycle_G = light ; duty_cycle_B = light ; set_timer (); start_timer (); } Part5. Done all. Really thanks to my teammate chialice123 who helps me alot during the semester and in the final project making the project score over 90 and overall semester score to be 95 (93 original and +2 adjust), and vava24680 for teaching me some concepts of ADC configuration.

Introduction. Ch2. Symmetric Encryption and Message Confidentiality Concept correction here: Assymetric encryption is not necessarily and absolutely better than the symmetric encryption, they can work with each other. Common type of the cryptanalysis Brute force attack On avg, half of the keys have to be tested. Ciphertext only attack Known the encryption algorithm Want to collect all the ciphtertext to find out the plaintext or ultimately, find out what the key is. Known plaintext attack Use the known plaintext and the correspond ciphertext which encrypted by the encryption algorithm and ultimately find out what the key is. Chosen plaintext attack Use the dedicatedly and carefully crafted plaintext, figuring out the characteristics about the algorithm and ultimately find out what the key is. Difference b/w known plaintext and chosen ciphertext See here Chosen ciphertext attack As we've done in the course project 1, we use the dedicatedly and carefully crafted plaintext, figuring out the characteristics about the algorithm and ultimately find out what the key is. Feistel cipher architecture * Model of symmetric encryption Encrypt and decrypt with the same key, the key should be shared through a secure manner. security of symmetric encryption depends on the secrecy of the key, not the secrecy of the algorithm, which means we should keep the secret key as safe as possible. RSA Encryption standard Asymmetric encryption standard. This encryption standard mainly focus on prime factorisation \u66f4\u591a\u8cc7\u8a0a\u53ef\u4ee5\u53c3\u8003 \u5916\u661f\u4eba\u7684\u7b46\u8a18 Course project1. Chosen cipher attack Will post report after the session of this homework ends. DES Encryption standard An encryption algorithm use round, permutation shift and XOR operation to generate the ciphertext. Divide the plaintext into 64-bit-long in size for each if the block, and use the same length key for encryption(actually the key is not in the same length since there are 8 bits used for the parity-checking during the encryption) Image src DES Briefly introduction Prone to brute force attack since the key space is too small to guarantee the safe area, so the safer 3-DES algorithm is used nowadays. 16rounds are needed for the encryption process The encryption and decryption are run under the same algorithm but they are in the reverse order with each other This is a model based on the Fiestel model , namely for the encryption and decryption they use the same function but in the reversed order. From DES to 3DES DES is not so secure since the key is 56bits long, which is quite prone to BF cryptanalysis 3DES lengthens the key of DES (56 * 3 = 168), doing DES 3 times to make the encryption safer. Please feel free to refer to my classmate's note for more information For encryption procedure: P--E(K1)--A--D(K2)--B--E(K3) C C--D(K1)--B--E(K2)--A--D(K3) A Since the Fiestel architecture, the encryption and decryption method are just the reverse of each other. For decryption procedure: AES Encryption standard Make a better encryption of 3DES, namely evolve from 3DES for a stronger and faster encryption algorithm. AES is still the same as the DES in the category of block cipher encryption, but the block size of AES is 128 bits, doubled of the DES encryption. 10 Rounds of encryption again and again is needed. Image source from textbook One grey-coloured box is the one \"round\" of the encryption in AES Each of the round we take the preceding round's output as the input of this round and do the encryption again, with the following 4 tasks to be done 1.The Substitution Bytes is to use the non-linear transform to let the input transformed with a \"Affine transformation\", making the encryption robust and hard to be cracked 2.The Shift Rows(Bit transposition) is shifting the data, to rearrange the text, for row i we shift i-1 times to the left. Image source from wikipedia 3.The Mix Columns is a linear transform under the mod multiplication 4.The Add Round Key is let the input XOR with the Key in the current state. (Rijndael key generator solution,which is a subkey in each round, which we can be seen from the image provided above that Key(16 bytes and expand to match for each round, divided into 10 subkeys for 10 operations in AES encryption)) 5.After the aforementioned four steps are done, go to the next encryption box. The operation is bytewise The truly random number and pseudo random number Applications of the random number 1.RSA pub-key generation and other pub-key algorithms. 2.Session key for encryption in system such as Wi-Fi, e-mail Image source from wikipedia The following 2 criteria are used to validate a sequence is random. 1.Uniform distribution: The each element in the seed of random number must take the same proportion of being taken out. 2.Independence: A sequence cannot be inferred from the other sequence, strictly and absolutely. Block cipher vs Stream cipher Stream cipher Change the encryption key from time to time, and each time the two part(sender-receiver) can generate the same random key s.t. they can encrypt and decrypt the same message. The key of such encryption algorithm should have a extremely large period and as random as possible, o.w. it is crack-prone. In order to guard the BF attack, the longer key is preferred (However there is a trade-off b/w speed and security.) As we can see the sender and receiver generate the same key for encryption and decryption. Image source from textbook RC4 Algorithm 1.An algorithm with changeable key length encryption. 2.SSL TLS WEP WPA use this encryption algorithm 3.Easy to implement in both HW ans SW, but terminated in 2015 due to attack RC4 Encryption procedure 1.Shuffle the key, make it randomised. for i from 0 to 255 S [ i ] := i endfor j : = 0 for ( i = 0 ; i 256 ; i ++ ) j : = ( j + S [ i ] + key [ i mod keylength ]) % 256 //randomly take the new j and swap, make a permutation swap values of S [ i ] and S [ j ] endfor 2.Get even more shuffle data, each time for a input byte, locate the i and j value by take the value in the key, XOR the inputByte with the key (since the reverse of XOR operation is itself, once we insert the ciphertext we'll get plaintext, and converse is true as well.) i : = 0 j : = 0 while GeneratingOutput : i : = ( i + 1 ) mod 256 //a j : = ( j + S [ i ]) mod 256 //b swap values of S [ i ] and S [ j ] //c k : = inputByte ^ S [( S [ i ] + S [ j ]) % 256 ] //XOR operation suit for this case. Reverse operation also works output K endwhile Block cipher Use the same key for the text, and divide the text into blocks, processing ONE BLOCK for each time. Processing procedure including shift position, substitute text to let the plaintext look similar, however, generating the totally different ciphertext for cryptographically secure. The AES(128 bits per block), DES(64 bits per block), 3DES(64 bits per block) are lie in this category. 5 Block modes for the block cipher, defined by NIST USA. Intended to use for the symmetric cipher. . 1.Electronic Code Book where Encryption: ciphertext[i] = code_book[plaintext[i]] just. Need a decryptor to do reversed tasks. 2.Cipher Block Chaining, take the step i's ciphertext XOR with next step's plaintext and encrypt again. If there is a bit error in the ciphertext, it will cause the decryption of plaintext i and plaintext i+1 error since they are chained together from step to step. 3.Cipher FeedBack , only the encryptor is needed, 2 times of encryption is equivalent to decryption (Reason: ). 4.CounTeR , use the counter directly for the key of encryption. Can be processed parallelly since each block can be processed with its counter and independent with other blocks, random access is suitable as well. And use the same key for decryption due to the properties of XOR operation, once the ciphertext XOR key --- plaintext is decrypted. The CTR mode is both HW and SW efficiency (parallelism are able to implemented in both CPU and compiler, OS ...etc). What's more, the preprocessing can be done as well, even without the presence of the plaintext, we can still generate the required key and the next task is just let plaintext XOR key --- ciphertext. 5.Output FeedBack similar too Cipher FeedBack, take the ciphertext from previous round and encrypt again Useful reference site ,MUST READ!!!

Message Authencation and Public Key Cryptography Message Authencation Code (MAC) Using some hash value of the data and encrypt that value at the end of data for validation (see the image below) Clarify!!: MAC cannot perform the data encryption, it can only be used for data authentication and validation.

Term explanation (waiting for the answer from OAlienO) 1.Message Digest Size: Message digest, MD(same as MD of MD5), of how much data amount we output, such as in the following SHA1 algorithm, we produce 160bits output (hex * 40 = 160). 2.Message Size: Message amount that we can process in one time(Maxium input). 3.Block Size: In block cipher, cut all the message into several blocks, in the block is how much message in a block to be processed 4.Word Size: A size of a given state. The following are the Message digest from the SHA512. Hashing, Why and How? hash youtube Hash aims for reduce the huge amount of data to the small amount. Can be used for verify and prevent the errors in the communication. Evan a small change in the original plaintext (such as only a bit), it will cause the totally different hash value, this result is called Avalanche Effect. It ensures the security of hash algorithm. Hash has to be one-way and pre image, collision-resistant, otherwise , data will be forged. Hash is doomed to be broken or cracked, what matters is that we have to try out best to lengthen the time before being cracked Hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) Watch out the color correspondence for better understanding the procedure HMAC vs CMAC?? so hmac vs cmac * AS we can see from the picture for HMAC (aforementioned) and CMAC, although both of them use the key, but in Message encryption vs Message digestion(hashing), what is the difference? so encryption-vs-digest so how-is-an-md5-or-sha-x-hash-different-from-an-encryption hash ,encryption and more so why-should-i-use-authenticated-encryption-instead-of-just-encryption Encryption: Really make the message secret, hard to be cracked and aims for security. key difference between encryption and hashing is that encrypted strings can be reversed back into their original decrypted form if you have the right key ex. RSA AES DES ... Digestion (hashing): Digest the whole data, may be used for message authentication, producing an ID or FINGERPRINT of the input data. Hashing is great for usage in any instance where you want to compare a value with a stored value, but can't store its plain representation for security reasons . Other use cases could be checking the last few digits of a credit card match up with user input or comparing the hash of a file you have with the hash of it stored in a database to make sure that they're both the same. ex. MD5 SHA ... Furthermore, if the digested data is encrypted, than it can be used for DIGITAL SIGNATURE. 1.For example in SHA family \u80fd\u8a08\u7b97\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u6578\u4f4d\u8a0a\u606f\u6240\u5c0d\u61c9\u5230\u7684\uff0c\u9577\u5ea6\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u5b57\u4e32\uff08\u53c8\u7a31\u8a0a\u606f\u6458\u8981\uff09\u7684\u6f14\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u4e14\u82e5\u8f38\u5165\u7684\u8a0a\u606f\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5b83\u5011\u5c0d\u61c9\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u5b57\u4e32\u7684\u6a5f\u7387\u5f88\u9ad8\u3002 OAlienO : SHA \u4e0d\u662f\u52a0\u5bc6\u56e0\u70ba\u4ed6\u6c92\u8fa6\u6cd5\u89e3\u56de\u539f\u672c\u7684 input Authenticated encryption (HMAC x CMAC x CCM = CMAC + AES block cipher + CTR block mode) A term used to describe encryption systems that simultaneously protect confidentiality and authenticity of communications. Compared with traditional encryption, the authenticated encryption additionally provides authenticity, while plain encryption provides only confidentiality. Usually more complicated than confidentiality-only or authenticity-only schemes. Public key cryptography Encrypt with public key: Want to send someone a message that only they(certain of groups,...etc) will be able to read, encrypt it with that person's public key. Encrypt with private key: Want to publish some information and guarantee that you're the author (Reason is that the only person who encrypt with HIS PRIVATE KEY CAN ONLY BE THE ORGINAL AUTHOR, and everyone can use the public related to that private key to decrypt it) , and that it hasn't been tampered with, then you encrypt it with your private key.(We can as well use the authenticated encryption to ensure the authenticity. Just like the aforementioned Digital signature ) so What is we encrypt with private key?? Private key vs Secret key, what is the difference? Private key: Use in asymmetric encryption. Secret key: Use in symmetric encryption, but it is quite hard for us (or say unsafe) to exchange secret key, so the Diffie Hellman key exchange algorithm is invented. Diffie Hellman key exchange A way to exchange the secret key via an unsafe path Math theory behind this algorithm SSL, TLS, SFTP use it. Like the AES implemetation AES is symmetric encryption and a shared-secret-key exchange is needed for end-to-end data encryption. Both of end to end does not need to know each other (or cant break) his / her private key but share a same secret key to do secret data exchange. In this algorithm, we should choose a very big a, b and p s.t. Bob is unable so solve 'a' of Alice's secret and neither is Alice. o.w. Eve will hack into it and solve the shared secret key. Aside from the RSA, why use Diffie Hellman key exchange? Since the process of RSA is quite burdensome (numbers in it are extremely huge) so if we can back to the traditional symmetric encryption such as AES (just now we need a \"secure pipe\" under the \"insecure pipe\") to perform key exchange. Than the end-to-end encryption can be achieved, what's more, this method is faster in which stream cipher are performed Man in the middle attack (MITM) The MITM forges the key of both side and deceives them, act as both fake Alice and Bob. And the wikipedia analogy ,note: sequence different from the image The core idea about this is still the mathematical expression, for example for the secret key K1, since Darth intercepts the message, then he can forge the key with his secret key XD2 ,due to the following mathematical theory about modulo exponential. So Alice is able to acquire the secret key via her own private key XA due to the upper math theory. BUT SHE DOES NOT KNOW THAT YD2 ACTUALLY COMES FROM DARTH and DARTH now share the same key with Alice, so Alice thinks that Darth is Bob!! and the same is true for Bob!! Originally the shared secret key should be lie on the mathematical expression like this Rather than this Ch.4 Key Distribution and User Authentication Key distribution Used in the symmetric key crypto system to exchange keys from one end point to another. Kerberos and its components User password will not be transmitted but will be used as a shared secret for the authentication Centralised key distribution and authentication service b/w user and server(3 rd party) that relies on symmetric encryption (No public key in it) Generates a symmetric secret key b/w two end points. Distributed system makes computing power better. During the key's lifetime (embedded in the message), the key can be used again and again. Central idea relies on the trustworthy 3RD PARTY SERVER Authencation server (AS) Authenticate the user Ticket granting server (TGS) Grant authenticated user permissions to act with the real server (SS, Service Server) wikipedia for detailed procedure Detailed explanation video Timestamp portocal vs Challenge-Response Portocal Timestamp portocal Record the timestamp of each data transaction. Prone to replay attack(a kind of MITM attack) if the clocks b/w the client and server is not synchronised But how come will this happen?? If the system time is not synchronised, then suppose the end point EA is slower, then the MITM can intercept the message b/w two endpoint and resend the password again to hack and pretend to be the genuine user. What's more, since the time is slower in EA, then as the MITM intercepts data and resend, it does need some time to \"RETRANSMIT\" , but it is the slower time that allows the delay of retransmit time not be discovered if the time difference |T_received - T_send| epsilon is not so strict. Challenge-Response Portocal Reference this video first! The server and the receiver share a certain kind of \"shared secret\" that might be generated as the user registered in the system. Ensures the \"Mutual Authentication\" The procedure as follows: Server sends a unique challenge value sc to the client Client sends a unique challenge value cc to the server Server computes sr = hash(cc + secret) and sends to the client Client computes cr = hash(sc + secret) and sends to the server Server calculates the expected value of cr and ensures the client responded correctly Client calculates the expected value of sr and ensures the server responded correctly where sc is the server generated challenge cc is the client generated challenge cr is the client response sr is the server response Since the secret is shared b/w the server and client, then is is able to verify the genuine of both server and client A good challenge/response system will generate a new challenge for every transaction or session (and make sure that previous challenges are not reused!), so that session transcripts cannot be spliced together to create new fraudulent systems. (Maybe the challenge will be encrypted in both parties) Comparison b/w Kerberos v4 and Kerberos v5 Reference here v4 is prone to MITM attack and v5 is not. Both of them provides mutual authentication What is mutual authentication and why we need it?? \u7591\u554f\uff1aMutual authentication \u76f8\u8f03\u65bc one way \u4ed6\u7684\u597d\u8655\u662f \u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u6642\u9a57\u8b49 \u4f3a\u670d\u5668\u65b9\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u65b9\u561b\uff1f\uff1f \u5c31\u662f\u4f3a\u670d\u5668\u80fd\u78ba\u8a8d\u9019\u500buser \u800c\u4e14\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u78ba\u8a8d\u9019\u500bserver \u4f46\u662f\u539f\u672c\u53ea\u6709usr\u4f86\u78ba\u8a8dserver \u591a\u51fa\u9019\u500bserver\u4f86\u78ba\u8a8dusr \u6703\u6709\u4ec0\u9ebc\u512a\u9ede\u5462\uff1f \u89e3\u7b54\uff1a\u56e0\u70bauser\u548cserver\u90fd\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u4eff\u5192\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u96d9\u91cd\u8a8d\u8b49\u96d9\u65b9\u3002 Both the server and client may be inpersonated, so we need to verify their real identification. Key distribution with asymmetric encryption (Public key certificate) The well known SSL use this method ,and the X.509 standard is used. Aimed to solve the problem that we want to verify the authentication of some authorities by the trusted certificated authority (CA) Step as follows Verify the signature that generated by CA to ensure the reality. What is the difference b/w the digital signature and public key authentication. From stackoverflow: A digital signature is used to verify a message. It is basically an encrypted hash (encrypted by the private key of the sender) of the message. The recipient can check if the message was tampered with by hashing the received message and comparing this value with the decrypted signature (decrypted the signature with the public key from the sender). To decrypt the signature, the corresponding public key is required. A digital certificate is used to bind public keys to persons or other entities. If there were no certificates, the signature could be easily be forged, as the recipient could not check if the public key belongs to the sender. Original discussion thread Similar reference The \"Chain of Trust\" SSL certificate, root certificate are all related to this topic Actually the public key certification (certification distribution of authorize a genuine key) is the core concept of SSL/TLS portocal Chain of Trust YouTube video Private key of root CA should be absolutely inaccessible. Once the \"Chain of Trust\" is successfully formed, an secure communication path can be formed (TLS using SSL certificate to do such things) So a question comes to my mind, What is the differenct b/w HTTPS,TLS and SSL? Answer as follows: 1.TLS is just the new name (or say acronym) of SSL Namely, SSL protocol got to version 3.0; TLS 1.0 is \"SSL 3.1\". TLS versions currently defined include TLS 1.1 and 1.2. Each new version adds a few features and modifies some internal details. We sometimes say \"SSL/TLS\". 2.HTTPS is the HTTP under the secured transmission protocol, i.e. HTTPS is HTTP-within-SSL/TLS. SSL (TLS) establishes a secured, bidirectional tunnel for arbitrary binary data between two hosts. Why chain of trust?? Even though the asymmetric (Public-key cryptography RSA) can ensure the secret communication, digital signature can ensure the correctness of content , however, we are still not sure about whether the issuer of the digital certificate is the real \"good guy\" or the \"forged guy.\" wikipedia ref PKI, CA, Key...etc great explanation video Here A public key infrastructure (PKI) is a set of roles, policies, and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke digital certificates and manage public-key encryption. When to revoke a user's certification?? The user\u2019s private key is assumed to be compromised(\u5047\u5b9a\u88ab\u6d29\u6f0f\u51fa\u53bb\u4e86) The user is no longer certified by this CA; reasons for this include subject\u2019s name has changed, the certificate is superseded, or the certificate was not issued in conformance with the CA\u2019s policies The CA\u2019s certificate is assumed to be compromised The PKI architecture PKI YouTube video * PKI is a framework that some vendor and use...etc should follow, and PKI associates a public key with a verified person/system. Ch.5 Cloud Security 802.1X, EAP(A framework) Used to control the access of user to the internet. provides a generic transport service for the exchange of authentication information between a client system and an authentication server. The authentication server gives the instruction to the gate / authenticator such that it can give the client the internet resource he wants or not. , auth methods through the EAP layer to reach the data link layer. Procedure as follows 1.EAPOL(OL stands for data encapsulation)-Start, start the eap 2.EAPOL(OL stands for data encapsulation)-EAP(REQ/IDENTITY) auth server wants to know the identity / 3.EAPOL(OL stands for data encapsulation)-EAP(RESPONSE/AUTH) five the clinet response 4.EAPOL(OL stands for data encapsulation)-Logoff end the connection Cloud Couputing Definition: Focus on what service cloud should have rather than a \"how to\" design architecture. a tool for describing, discussing, and developing a system-specific architecture using a common framework of reference.

SSL session: Association b/w the client and the server wikipedia NetAdmin SSL Record Portocol Confidentiality with Handshake protocol to ensure that no one intercept in the pipeline, encrypt the data with secret key. Message integrity: With a shared secret key to ensure the MAC code such that we may check whether the data has been modified or not. Pre master, master secret, private, shared / session key Pre master key: Allow for the uniform format of the master key.(Aim for the greater consistency) Master key is the agreement of both endpoint, master_secret = PRF(pre_master secret, \"master secret\"(aims for tag of current thing), Client ran + Server ran (or the Alice ran add up with the Bob ran)) Check here Cryptographic Computations TLS, HTTPS = HTTP + SSL/TLS HTTP under a secure transport layer Port 443 will be used since it invokes the SSL The normal HTTP close we just need HTTP close, while the HTTPS we need the TLS which involves the underlying TCP connection. TLS requires the two entity of TCP in both client and server side. TLS should agree and exchange the closure alerts before closing connection.

Common Wireless Network Threats: Accidental association, Malicious association, AD-HOC Networks, Identity theft(MAC Spoofing), MITM attack, DoS, Network injection. Protect against wireless eavesdropping Signal hiding(not so practical) and encryption(kind of practical). Protect the access point Main threat is the unauthorized access to the network. The 802.1X standard. provides the authentication for device wishing connecting to the LAN/WLAN. Mobile device security Major security issues are: Lack of physical security controls Use of untrusted mobile devices Use of untrusted networks Use of untrusted content Use of applications created by unknownparties Interaction with other systems Use of location services 802.11i Wireless protocol Controlled ports:PDU exchange within LAN b/w supplicant and other systems only if supplicant authorizes such an exchange Uncontrolled ports: Allows PDU exchange b/w supplicant and other RS regardless the authentication state.

Here MIC is the message integrity code to ensure the integrity of the message. What is the purpose of ANonce and SNonce? As we can see from the 2017mid2 , they are used to generated the PTK for both the STA and AP, also the back SNonce serves like a challenge-response protocol to ensure the freshness and the alive of STA that there is no MITM attack and the same is true for AP. The GTK is used for decrypting the data of multicast and broadcast traffic, all of the STAs share the same GTK. GTK is distributed after the pairwise keys that already established (Use PK generated before to enctypt the GTK key ) GTK Changed every time as device leaves network(yes TRANSIENT KEY!) TK with TKIP or CCMP are used for traffic key(encryption for data transfer phase) provides message integrity and data confidentiality. HMAC-SHA1 are used to generated nonce, expand pairwise keys and to generate GTK, PTK(transient key) Ch8. EMAIL Security (Pretty Good Privacy) Provides a confidentiality and authentication service that can be used for electronic mail and file storage applications PGP also provides the message authentication and the message integrity. Services 1.Digital signature: DSS, RSA , SHA 2.Message encryption: CAST, IDEA, 3DES 3.Compression: zip 4.email compatibility: Base64 encryption PGP Authencation RSA ensures that only the mail sender signed with the digital sender, encrypt w his/her private key, can be decrypted with his/her public key, thus ensures the identity. SHA ensures that no one can generated the message with the same hash code PGP Confidentiality and Authentication 64bits CFB is used, using the block cipher , symmetric encryption. In PGP, each symmetric key is used only once.(The session key is bound with the message and transmitted.) Encrypt the sesion key with the receiver's public key. PGP Compression PGP compresses the msg after signature but before encryption. If sign after the compression, then the version of compression will be constrained since different compression leads to different encoding thus different hash result even with the same source data. PGP E-mail Compatibility Radix64(B64) encoding to convert them into printable ASCII chars. Append the CRC to protect the transmission error. S/MIME Security enhancement for the MIME Another standard besides PGP MIME MIME improve from SMTP 5 Headers are defined, to fully describe the email, MIME-ver, content type, content-transfer encoding, content-ID, content description. S/MIME Functionality Enveloped data: encrypted content of any type and encrypted content encryption keys for one or more recipients. Signed data, message digest of content and digital signature with the private key of the signer.

Although the typical behavior of an intruder differs from the typical behavior of an authorized user, there is an overlap in these behaviors. Thus, a loose interpretation of intruder behavior, which will catch more intruders, will also lead to a number of \"false positives,\" or authorized users identified as intruders. On the other hand, an attempt to limit false positives by a tight interpretation of intruder behavior will lead to an increase in false negatives, or intruders not identified as intruders. Thus, there is an element of compromise and art in the practice of intrusion detection. audit record Fundamental tool for intrusion detection \u5229\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u7d00\u9304\u7b46\u4f86\u5206\u6790\u70ba\u6b04\u4f4d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6307\u4ee4\u5075\u6e2c\u7cfb\u7d71\u5c07\u78b0\u649e\u627e\u51fa Threshold detection : \u8a08\u7b97\u67d0\u4e00\u4e8b\u4ef6\u767c\u751f\u7684\u6b21\u6578\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u6b21\u6578\u8d85\u904e\u4e00\u500b\u7279\u5b9a\u6578\u5b57\u5c31\u4ee3\u8868\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u906d\u53d7\u5165\u4fb5(\u7c21\u964b\u4e14\u6c92\u6548\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5) Profile-based : \u4ee5\u904e\u53bb\u7684\u884c\u70ba\u548c\u73fe\u5728\u7684\u6bd4\u8f03\u5f8c\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u6709\u91cd\u5927\u504f\u5dee(detecting significant deviations)\u4ee3\u8868\u53ef\u80fd\u906d\u53d7\u653b\u64ca Rule-Based Intrusion Dectection : \u5617\u8a66\u8a02\u5b9a\u4e00\u4e9b\u898f\u5247\u898f\u77e9\uff0c\u5c08\u9580\u7528\u4f86\u6aa2\u67e5\u51fa\u7cfb\u7d71\u662f\u5426\u6709\u4e0d\u7576\u7684\u5165\u4fb5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5 Rule-based anomaly detection Rule-based penetration identification USTAT \u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u5165\u4fb5\u8005\u6aa2\u6e2c(distributed intrusion detection) def: \u5c0d\u65bc\u4e00\u6574\u500b\u7d44\u7e54\u9700\u8981\u61c9\u4ed8\u5c0d\u65bc\u6574\u500b\u7db2\u8def\u62d3\u6a38\u652f\u6490\u8d77\u4f86\u7684\u4e3b\u6a5f\u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u5c07\u6578\u500b\u4e3b\u6a5f\u7684\u5165\u4fb5\u6aa2\u6e2c\u7cfb\u7d71\u806f\u5408\u8d77\u4f86\u7528 \u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u6709\u4ee5\u4e0b\u56f0\u5883: \u4e0d\u540c\u4e3b\u6a5f\u7684audit record\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u4e00\u6a23\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8655\u7406\u683c\u5f0f\u554f\u984c honeypot \u662f\u4e00\u500b\u96fb\u8166\u8853\u8a9e\uff0c\u5c08\u6307\u7528\u4f86\u5075\u6e2c\u6216\u62b5\u79a6\u672a\u7d93\u6388\u6b0a\u64cd\u4f5c\u6216\u8005\u662f\u99ed\u5ba2\u653b\u64ca\u7684\u9677\u9631 \u8a73\u7d30def: \u871c\u7f50\u901a\u5e38\u507d\u88dd\u6210\u770b\u4f3c\u6709\u5229\u7528\u50f9\u503c\u7684\u7db2\u8def\u3001\u8cc7\u6599\u3001\u96fb\u8166\u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u4e26\u6545\u610f\u8a2d\u7f6e\u4e86bug\uff0c\u7528\u4f86\u5438\u5f15\u99ed\u5ba2\u653b\u64ca\u3002\u7531\u65bc\u871c\u7f50\u4e8b\u5be6\u4e0a\u4e26\u672a\u5c0d\u7db2\u8def\u63d0\u4f9b\u4efb\u4f55\u6709\u50f9\u503c\u7684\u670d\u52d9\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4efb\u4f55\u5c0d\u871c\u7f50\u7684\u5617\u8a66\u90fd\u662f\u53ef\u7591\u7684\u3002\u871c\u7f50\u4e2d\u9084\u53ef\u80fd\u88dd\u6709\u76e3\u63a7\u8edf\u9ad4\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u76e3\u8996\u99ed\u5ba2\u5165\u4fb5\u5f8c\u7684\u8209\u52d5\u3002 \u53ef\u4ee5\u5c07\u99ed\u5ba2\u5f9e\u771f\u6b63\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7cfb\u7d71\u5f15\u958b\u5230\u871c\u7f50(\u871c\u7f50\u505a\u70ba\u8a98\u990c)\uff0c\u871c\u7f50\u548c\u771f\u5be6\u7cfb\u7d71\u662fisolated\u7684 \u4e5f\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u871c\u7f50\u4f86\u85c9\u6a5f\u8490\u96c6\u653b\u64ca\u8005\u7684\u8cc7\u8a0a(\u871c\u7f50\u662f\u88abmonitored\u7684) pdf p29 30(\u8003\u524d\u4e00\u5929\u770b\uff0c\u5167\u5bb9\u504f\u6b7b\u8a18) password management Front line of defense against intruders implementation Crypt(3) : \u721b \u7528\u4f86\u5687\u963b\u5bc6\u78bc\u731c\u6e2c\u653b\u64ca \u4f46\u662f\u56e0\u70ba\u6700\u65e9\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u76f8\u5bb9\u6027\u8f03\u597d\u3002\u800c\u4eca\u4ecd\u7136\u88ab\u5ee3\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528 MD5 secure hash algorithm : \u4e2d \u529f\u80fd\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6bd4Crypt(3)\u6162(trade off) Bcrypt : \u597d UNIX\u7cfb\u7d71\u4e2d\u6700\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u52a0\u9e7d+\u96dc\u6e4a\u65b9\u6cd5 \u529f\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u53c8\u66f4\u6162\u4e86(trade off) Ch12.

Although the typical behavior of an intruder differs from the typical behavior of an authorized user, there is an overlap in these behaviors. Thus, a loose interpretation of intruder behavior, which will catch more intruders, will also lead to a number of \"false positives,\" or authorized users identified as intruders. On the other hand, an attempt to limit false positives by a tight interpretation of intruder behavior will lead to an increase in false negatives, or intruders not identified as intruders. Thus, there is an element of compromise and art in the practice of intrusion detection. audit record Fundamental tool for intrusion detection \u5229\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u7d00\u9304\u7b46\u4f86\u5206\u6790\u70ba\u6b04\u4f4d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6307\u4ee4\u5075\u6e2c\u7cfb\u7d71\u5c07\u78b0\u649e\u627e\u51fa Threshold detection : \u8a08\u7b97\u67d0\u4e00\u4e8b\u4ef6\u767c\u751f\u7684\u6b21\u6578\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u6b21\u6578\u8d85\u904e\u4e00\u500b\u7279\u5b9a\u6578\u5b57\u5c31\u4ee3\u8868\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u906d\u53d7\u5165\u4fb5(\u7c21\u964b\u4e14\u6c92\u6548\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5) Profile-based : \u4ee5\u904e\u53bb\u7684\u884c\u70ba\u548c\u73fe\u5728\u7684\u6bd4\u8f03\u5f8c\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u6709\u91cd\u5927\u504f\u5dee(detecting significant deviations)\u4ee3\u8868\u53ef\u80fd\u906d\u53d7\u653b\u64ca Rule-Based Intrusion Dectection : \u5617\u8a66\u8a02\u5b9a\u4e00\u4e9b\u898f\u5247\u898f\u77e9\uff0c\u5c08\u9580\u7528\u4f86\u6aa2\u67e5\u51fa\u7cfb\u7d71\u662f\u5426\u6709\u4e0d\u7576\u7684\u5165\u4fb5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5 Rule-based anomaly detection Rule-based penetration identification USTAT \u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u5165\u4fb5\u8005\u6aa2\u6e2c(distributed intrusion detection) def: \u5c0d\u65bc\u4e00\u6574\u500b\u7d44\u7e54\u9700\u8981\u61c9\u4ed8\u5c0d\u65bc\u6574\u500b\u7db2\u8def\u62d3\u6a38\u652f\u6490\u8d77\u4f86\u7684\u4e3b\u6a5f\u67b6\u69cb\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u5c07\u6578\u500b\u4e3b\u6a5f\u7684\u5165\u4fb5\u6aa2\u6e2c\u7cfb\u7d71\u806f\u5408\u8d77\u4f86\u7528 \u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u6703\u6709\u4ee5\u4e0b\u56f0\u5883: \u4e0d\u540c\u4e3b\u6a5f\u7684audit record\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u4e00\u6a23\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8655\u7406\u683c\u5f0f\u554f\u984c","title":"intrusion detection"},{"location":"univ_notes/network_security/network_security/#honeypot","text":"\u662f\u4e00\u500b\u96fb\u8166\u8853\u8a9e\uff0c\u5c08\u6307\u7528\u4f86\u5075\u6e2c\u6216\u62b5\u79a6\u672a\u7d93\u6388\u6b0a\u64cd\u4f5c\u6216\u8005\u662f\u99ed\u5ba2\u653b\u64ca\u7684\u9677\u9631 \u8a73\u7d30def: \u871c\u7f50\u901a\u5e38\u507d\u88dd\u6210\u770b\u4f3c\u6709\u5229\u7528\u50f9\u503c\u7684\u7db2\u8def\u3001\u8cc7\u6599\u3001\u96fb\u8166\u7cfb\u7d71\uff0c\u4e26\u6545\u610f\u8a2d\u7f6e\u4e86bug\uff0c\u7528\u4f86\u5438\u5f15\u99ed\u5ba2\u653b\u64ca\u3002\u7531\u65bc\u871c\u7f50\u4e8b\u5be6\u4e0a\u4e26\u672a\u5c0d\u7db2\u8def\u63d0\u4f9b\u4efb\u4f55\u6709\u50f9\u503c\u7684\u670d\u52d9\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4efb\u4f55\u5c0d\u871c\u7f50\u7684\u5617\u8a66\u90fd\u662f\u53ef\u7591\u7684\u3002\u871c\u7f50\u4e2d\u9084\u53ef\u80fd\u88dd\u6709\u76e3\u63a7\u8edf\u9ad4\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u76e3\u8996\u99ed\u5ba2\u5165\u4fb5\u5f8c\u7684\u8209\u52d5\u3002 \u53ef\u4ee5\u5c07\u99ed\u5ba2\u5f9e\u771f\u6b63\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7cfb\u7d71\u5f15\u958b\u5230\u871c\u7f50(\u871c\u7f50\u505a\u70ba\u8a98\u990c)\uff0c\u871c\u7f50\u548c\u771f\u5be6\u7cfb\u7d71\u662fisolated\u7684 \u4e5f\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u871c\u7f50\u4f86\u85c9\u6a5f\u8490\u96c6\u653b\u64ca\u8005\u7684\u8cc7\u8a0a(\u871c\u7f50\u662f\u88abmonitored\u7684)","title":"honeypot"},{"location":"univ_notes/network_security/network_security/#pdf-p29-30","text":"","title":"pdf p29 30(\u8003\u524d\u4e00\u5929\u770b\uff0c\u5167\u5bb9\u504f\u6b7b\u8a18)"},{"location":"univ_notes/network_security/network_security/#password-management","text":"Front line of defense against intruders implementation Crypt(3) : \u721b \u7528\u4f86\u5687\u963b\u5bc6\u78bc\u731c\u6e2c\u653b\u64ca \u4f46\u662f\u56e0\u70ba\u6700\u65e9\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u76f8\u5bb9\u6027\u8f03\u597d\u3002\u800c\u4eca\u4ecd\u7136\u88ab\u5ee3\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528 MD5 secure hash algorithm : \u4e2d \u529f\u80fd\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6bd4Crypt(3)\u6162(trade off) Bcrypt : \u597d UNIX\u7cfb\u7d71\u4e2d\u6700\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u52a0\u9e7d+\u96dc\u6e4a\u65b9\u6cd5 \u529f\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u53c8\u66f4\u6162\u4e86(trade off)","title":"password management"},{"location":"univ_notes/network_security/network_security/#ch12-firewalls","text":"","title":"Ch12.

Camera Calibration Mar 29, 2018 Course pdf Camera Calibration (From official openCV document)Basically, you need to take snapshots of these patterns with your camera and let OpenCV find them. Each found pattern results in a new equation. To solve the equation you need at least a predetermined number of pattern snapshots to form a well-posed equation system. This number is higher for the chessboard pattern and less for the circle ones. For example, in theory the chessboard pattern requires at least two snapshots. However, in practice we have a good amount of noise present in our input images, so for good results you will probably need at least 10 good snapshots of the input pattern in different positions.
